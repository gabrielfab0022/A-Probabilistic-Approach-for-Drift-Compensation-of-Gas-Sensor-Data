# A-Probabilistic-Approach-for-Drift-Compensation-of-Gas-Sensor-Data
This repository contains a Julia implementation of the drift compensation method proposed in the paper "A Probabilistic Approach for Drift Compensation of Gas Sensor Data" . It also includes the simulations that were presented in the toy example in the paper, as well as the outlier detection algorithm that was used (PCOut)
