# A-Probabilistic-Approach-for-Drift-Compensation-of-Gas-Sensor-Data
This repository contains a Julia implementation of the drift compensation method proposed in the paper "A Probabilistic Approach for Drift Compensation of Gas Sensor Data" . It also includes the simulations that were presented in the toy example in the paper, as well as the outlier detection algorithm that was used (PCOut). 

Data availability:
The dataset used in this study was provided by a collaborator under a restricted data-sharing agreement and cannot be publicly redistributed. This repository contains the full source code used for the experiments and detailed instructions to reproduce the analysis once access to the dataset is obtained.
